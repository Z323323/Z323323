## Math
### Number theory related stuff (can't say you should look into it, there are many [ potentially useless ] rabbit holes)

- [Number theory interlude 2](https://github.com/Z323323/Number-theory-interlude-2)
- [Complex numbers background](https://github.com/Z323323/Complex-numbers-background)
- [Roots of unity](https://github.com/Z323323/Roots-of-unity)

### Group theory and omo/iso-morphisms related concepts (this might actually be useful but I don't guarantee correctness of everything I wrote about groups)

## Generating scientific docs with LaTeX for free, on your machine
### Using terminal for FREE LaTeX (scientific) documentation production in an Ubuntu environment (recommended, it's faster, better, and more stable than Spacemacs, and more elegant too)
